# Assignment 1

### A Fraction class with all operator overloads. 

For this assignment you will create a Fraction class. Create a Visual Studio solution with two projects, a library project that contains Fraction.h and Fraction.cpp, and a test project (google test). The provided test.cpp file contains 40 unit tests. You must write your fraction class such that it passes all unit tests. Do not change the test.cpp file, I will be testing your project against my copy of test.cpp. 

Your mark will be out or 45, 1 mark for each unit test that you pass, and 5 marks for comments and meaningful identifier names. 

#### gcd()

You can use your gcd() function from last term, or you can `#include <numeric>`  and use std::gcd(). You may have to change the project settings to use the C++17 Standard to get the std::gcd() function (project settings -> C/C++ -> Language -> C++ Language Standard)
